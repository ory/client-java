This endpoint behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:  &#x60;choose_method&#x60; expects &#x60;flow&#x60; (in the URL query) and &#x60;email&#x60; (in the body) to be sent and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows. For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header &#x60;Accept: application/json&#x60; it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid and a HTTP 303 See Other redirect with a fresh verification flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired). For Browser clients without HTTP Header &#x60;Accept&#x60; or with &#x60;Accept: text/_*&#x60; it returns a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended. &#x60;sent_email&#x60; is the success state after &#x60;choose_method&#x60; when using the &#x60;link&#x60; method and allows the user to request another verification email. It works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in &#x60;choose_method&#x60; state. &#x60;passed_challenge&#x60; expects a &#x60;token&#x60; to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow (\&quot;sending a verification link\&quot;) does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 303 See Other redirect either to the Settings UI URL (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Verification UI URL with a new Verification Flow ID which contains an error message that the verification link was invalid.

     * Check Who the Current HTTP Session Belongs To
     *
     * Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated. Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent. Additionally when the request it successful it adds the user ID to the &#39;X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id&#39; header in the response.  If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example router.get(&#39;/protected-endpoint&#39;, async function (req, res) { const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(undefined, req.header(&#39;cookie&#39;))  console.log(session) }) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js pseudo-code example ... const session &#x3D; await client.toSession(\&quot;the-session-token\&quot;)  console.log(session) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.  This endpoint is useful for:  AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly! Reverse proxies and API Gateways Server-side calls - use the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; header!  This endpoint authenticates users by checking  if the &#x60;Cookie&#x60; HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie; if the &#x60;Authorization: bearer &lt;ory-session-token&gt;&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token; if the &#x60;X-Session-Token&#x60; HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.  If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.  As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The &#x60;error.id&#x60; can be one of:  &#x60;session_inactive&#x60;: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token). &#x60;session_aal2_required&#x60;: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.

     * Update an Ory Cloud Project Configuration
     *
     * This endpoints allows you to update the Ory Cloud Project configuration for individual services (identity, permission, ...). The configuration is fully compatible with the open source projects for the respective services (e.g. Ory Kratos for Identity, Ory Keto for Permissions).  This endpoint expects the &#x60;version&#x60; key to be set in the payload. If it is unset, it will try to import the config as if it is from the most recent version.  If you have an older version of a configuration, you should set the version key in the payload!  While this endpoint is able to process all configuration items related to features (e.g. password reset), it does not support operational configuration items (e.g. port, tracing, logging) otherwise available in the open source.  For configuration items that can not be translated to Ory Cloud, this endpoint will return a list of warnings to help you understand which parts of your config could not be processed.  Be aware that updating any service&#39;s configuration will completely override your current configuration for that service!
